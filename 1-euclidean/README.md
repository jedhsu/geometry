## Level 1 - Euclidean Space

Euclidean space models the physical universe from the human's visual perspective.

It is intuitively motivated by embedding the number line onto physical space. TODO this is not well-said.

This results in the concept of area, and then vector spaces & calculus (much later).

Prototypical example is R^n.

#### Example: Pixel Geometry
