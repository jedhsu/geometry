## Geometry

`Geometry` is an experimental framework that implements models of geometric reasoning.

`Geometry` explores the mathematical concept of space and how it has generalized over the history of mathematics.

The `Space` is implemented at each level such that each increasing level's `Space` supertraits the previous.

* Level 1: [Eucildean](
* Level 2: Hilbert
* Level 3: Topological
* Level 4A: Categorical
* Level 4B: Homotypical
* Level 5A: N-Categorical
* Level 5B: N-Homotypical

The degrees of generalization and abstraction follow the progress quite closely.

Rust's expressive type system enables this work through use of generics.

A goal is to find practical applicatio of the intuitively profound principles currently emerging in computational trinitarism, The goal for this is to provide a framework for space.

### [L1] Euclidean

Euclideal space.

#### Example: Rasterization

### [L2] Hilbert

Hilbert space.

#### Example: Oscillation

### [L3] Topological

Topological space from a point-set perspective.

#### Example: Lorentzian Manifold

### [L4] Triadic

#### [L4A] Categorical

#### [L4B] Homotypical

#### Example: Neural Network

#### [L5A] N-Categorical

#### [L5B] N-Homotypical

### Future Goals

Use Topos
