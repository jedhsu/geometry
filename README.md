## Geometry

`Geometry` is a framework for geometric modeling & reasoning, written in Rust.

`Geometry` explores the concept of space how it as evolved and generalized from its physical perspective in Ancient Greece to the abstract category-theoretic perspective of the modern day, and find practical applications.

It models space from the seven paradigms of generalization.
* Level 1: Eucildean
* Level 2: Hilbert
* Level 3: Topological
* Level 4A: Categorical
* Level 4B: Homotypical
* Level 5A: N-Categorical
* Level 5B: N-Homotypical

We also want a practical framework with following goals: TODO.

Rust's expressive type system enables this work through use of generics.

A goal is to find practical applicatio of the intuitively profound principles currently emerging in computational trinitarism, The goal for this is to provide a framework for space.

Blurb about aspiring on how to look at data & structure from a more geometric perspective.

### Euclidean (

#### Example: Rasterization

### Hilbert

#### Example: Oscillation

### Topological

#### Example: Lorentzian Manifold

### Categorical

#### Example: Neural Network

### Triadic

### Fractological

### Future Goals

Use Topos
