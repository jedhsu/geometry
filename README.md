## Geometry

`geometry` explores the notion of geometric space and how it as evolved and generalized from its conception in Ancient Greece to the category-theoretic perspective of the modern day.

It explores space
* Eucildean space.
* Hilbert space.
* Topological space.
* Toposic space.

Rust's expressive type system enables this work through use of generics.

A goal is to find practical applicatio of the intuitively profound principles currently emerging in computational trinitarism, The goal for this is to provide a framework for space.

### Euclidean Space

### Hilbert Space

### Topological Space

### Toposic Space

### Future Goals

Use Topos
