## Level 3 - Topology

The topological space generalizes the Hilbert space by relaxing the idea of continuity.

Relaxed concept of space allows us to analyze spaces from mathematical physics.

### Background

#### Example: Lorentzian Manifold

#### Example: Opionion on Measure Theory???

#### Example: Symmetries of a cube
