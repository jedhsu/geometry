## Categorical

Category study is the study of spaces. Compared to the past, a Categorical Space focuses not on the "pointful elements", but the "morphisms" of elements and functions.

Intuitively, the morphism of every day life is the analogy.

Consider that the topological space is defined to be a set with structure. The intuitive meaning of this implies that a category is a Space.
